	  <h2>About</h2>
	    <p>Personally, I prefer to play the electric guitar. Unlike acoustic guitar, electric guitar is a bit more difficult to get started with.
	       With electric guitar, there’s a virtually endless number of gears and effect shat are really as important to learn as the actual instrument itself.
		   The major upside with electric guitar though is that your ears learn to be acutely aware of tone, from the very beginning. In contrast, acoustic guitar players may never really develop that same ear for tone, because it’s never within their control to actually change. It is easy however, with electric guitar, to get consumed with the abundance of possible effects, distracting from one from learning fundamentals.</p>

	    <p>Whether it’s writing original material or learning a song for a band, the guitar is unlike any other instrument for unleashing your creativity. If you need to get creative for other areas of your life, such as writing an essay for school or pulling together some ideas for your boss, picking up the guitar and noodling around for a few minutes can create space in your brain for an inspired idea to drop in. Playing the guitar can provide a much needed mental escape, as well as 
	    allowing your minds creative juices to get flowing. Overall, playing guitar reconnects an individual with their creativity.</p>
