		  <h2>Yale School of Art Website</h2>

		  <!-- NEXT TIME USE AN ORDERED LIST, OR UNORDERED LIST INSTEAD OF MANUALLY IMPORTING THE NUMBERS -->
		  <dt><b>(a) What is the URL of the website</b></dt>
			  <dd><a href="http://art.yale.edu/">http://art.yale.edu/</a></dd>
		  <dt><b>(b) Is the page appealing or unappealing? List three reasons for your answer.</b></dt>
			  <dd><i>The page is unappealing</i></dd>
			  <dd>(1) The background consists of a multitude of moving images, or gifs, that distract the user from other parts of the website.</dd>
			  <dd>(2) The information is scattered which makes it hard for the user to find what they're looking for efficiently.</dd>
			  <dd>(3) There is a great deal if unused space that serves no purpose, not even stylistic. Additionally, there are excess pictures and text that are meaningless to the function of the website.</dd>
		  <dt><b>(c) If the page is unappealing, what would you do to improve it?</b></dt>
			  <dd>I would improve this page in many ways. First, I would change the background to something simple, that does not take away from the rest of the page. Then, I would rearrange all of the elements in the page the user uses to access infromation to make them more accessible and apparent. After that, I would take all of the necessary pictures, and put them in places that add to the website and fit with the style (and I'd delete all of the unecessary images and infromation). Then, I'd completely change the style of every minor detial on the wesbite I did not already, including things like text size, font, etc.</dd>
