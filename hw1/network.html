  	  <dt>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</dt>
	      <dd>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a set of rules that allow files to be exchanged between com- puters on the Internet. Unlike HTTP, which is used by web browsers to request web pages and their associated files in order to display a web page, FTP is used simply to move files from one computer to another. Web developers commonly use FTP to transfer web page files from their computers to web servers. FTP is also commonly used to download pro- grams and files from other servers to individual computers.</dd>
	    <dt>E-mail Protocols</dt>
	      <dd>Most of us take e-mail for granted, but there are two servers involved in its smooth func- tioning: an incoming mail server and an outgoing mail server. When you send e-mail to others, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used. When you receive e-mail, Post Office Protocol (POP; currently POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) can be used.</dd>
	    <dt>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</dt>
	      <dd>HTTP is a set of rules for exchanging files such as text, images, audio, video, and other multimedia on the Web. Web browsers and web servers usually use this protocol. When the user of a web browser requests a file by typing a website address or clicking on a hyperlink, the browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the server. The web server in the destination machine receives the request, does any necessary processing, and responds with the requested file and any associated files (such as image files, media files, and other related files).</dd>
